# User manual 

## Log in

* Log in using a university email provided that the university is subscribed to Microsoft Office 365.

## Create Activity

* If the email address used to log in does not contain the string `@student` then your account will be registered as a `teacher` which allows you access to the `Create Activity` page.
* You can use the pre-made `students.csv` and `markers.csv` files in the `files-for-testing` folder for creating a new activity.

## Status page

* The status page contains all of the activities you are enrolled in.
* By following the instructions in the `readme.md` file, a sample activity should appear in the status page.

## Judging page

* The sample activity should be in the judging phase and have dummy submissions for you to judge. A link to the judging page should appear under `Marking information` for the sample activity.
* A table of rankings should appear after a few rounds of ACJ are completed. A single round of ACJ requires many comparisons to be made.

## Submission page

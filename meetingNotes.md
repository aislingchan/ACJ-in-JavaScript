# Supervisor Meeting Notes

## Week 3 (6 Oct 2022)

- Read through [Steve Draper's site on ACJ](https://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/myNewWave/apr/)
- Read [The Method of Adaptive Comparative Judgement paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0969594X.2012.665354)
- Look through [Niall Barr's ACJ GitHub repo](https://github.com/niallb/ACJ-LTI)
- The web app will be composed of a (1) front end viewer, (2) calculation module, and (3) data storage.
- Store your project documents in 3 places - USB, local machine, cloud
- Regularly sync your work
- Students could also be assessors (for peer reviewing assignments). Remember to include this functionality
- Think about how a course convenor would set up an assignment on the web app. They need to specify acceptable file types, deadlines, etc.
- Think about what database you will use - Firebase, MongoDB, or some other key value storage
- The web app will run on your machine right now. It will be run on a virtual machine in the future
- Come up with user stories for next week
- Next meeting Thursday 13th October 3pm

### Plan for next week:

- Populate the Trello board with tasks
- Analyse the implementations I have found and try to understand them. Start with the one written by Niall Barr
- Set up the web app


## Week 4 (13 Oct 2022)

- Use OAuth 2 for authorizing users, then use Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) later. Write in a modular way to make the switch easier.
- Keep a bibliography (as a BibTeX file). Add to it as you read more material
- Sync your work! (across USB, local machine, cloud)
- Think about how to test your ACJ web app against Niall Barr's
- Next meeting 2:30pm Thursday 20 October 2022

### Plan for next week:

- Finish translating Niall Barr's ACJ algorithms
- Build web page for comparing scripts. Implement functionality for selecting one of the two scripts so we can have input into our algorithm
- Read more about ACJ. Go through The Method of ACJ paper again.
- Think about how to test the web app against Niall Barr's
